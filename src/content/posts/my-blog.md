Well, this is the first post of this blog. I was thinking about
create a blog may time ago, but I never had a good theme. I mean,
I love a lot of things, but move a lot with all my interest, so
any theme don't will have many updates, and I'm not too crazy
to create a of blogs.

But something changed. These days, I had a lot of thoughts,
worlds that want to go out of my chest. So I decided that this
blog will be just about me.

No fancy themes, not so detailed, just the broken me. My head
feels confused a lot of time, so this will be just a scape of
that.

Probably a lot of days just will be me throwing stupid things.
Other days maybe something interesting that I found. I hope
that this blog help somebody, but I don't mind if nobody read
these words.
