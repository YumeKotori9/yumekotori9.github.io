Sometimes I would like to know if normal people know what is the purpose of
his life. Because I don't.

I even struggle with thoughts if I'm a normal human being. Sometimes I just
feel isolated from everyone.

But if I think carefully, this is normal. I'm me, and no one is like me.
Other people can have many of my traits, but me there's only one.

But this idea makes me feeling lonely. What is my purpose if I never will
be with someone that is like me.

People normally find people that complements or are equal to them. But when
I do the same, I just think in things that makes me different from those
people. And I feel bad, cause I will never be like them, I will never
understand what they feel.

There is just one me. And there is just one of every people.

It's stupid, I know. This sounds like some egotistical shit. Like if just me
is special.

I think that everyone is special. A history that makes a person being themself
but this makes me feel isolated.

We are just a footnote or a paragraph in the history of other people.

I just need to accept that I will be alone. That I can only share some
sparkles and not to share the same light.

But this is stupid. People have lived in this way for millennium. Why I'm
just complaining about this. What makes me feel like a shit of thinking this.

There is nothing bad in being just a footnote in a another person life. I must
feel happy of being part. I know that I'm just being dramatic and that
something is just bad about me.

Why I feel bad about a thing that the majority of people just know that is
normal. I'm not so special or interesting to be allowed to complain.

I'm just stupid. And my stupid brain that wants to feel special even if
there is nothing special about that.
