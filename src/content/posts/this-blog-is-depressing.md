Well, this blog is fucking depressing. I mean, the only thing I do is just
putting all my mental shit here. But this blog isn't for that. Was thought as
a escape. I'm not that depressive everyday. But I think is like the hater
comments, are too noisy that just are more visible than happy thoughts.

In this kind of days, when I'm concious about what I do, I tend to just
delete everything. Pretend as never existed. But those days exist. I'm not
a happy person, but I'm not depressed all day.

But I only have the necessity of express myself when I have a bad mood.
This way, maybe the best I can do is just express myself for everything. The
bad times, but also the good ones.

This mean that I will stop my bullshit? No, this only means more bullshit.
Bullshit about everything my mind have. Or something that happened and was
interesting (obviously for me, I don't pretend that is interesting for anyone
else).

Maybe something that I learnt that day, or just a thought that comes to my
mind.

This blog is just for me. I'll write as if another person was reading, but
I don't pretend that anybody read this lines.

If you are a person other than me, sorry. This blog is just bullshit, a mess
without context. Please keep off, this is digital garbage.
